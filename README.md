## How it Works

It's simple, ploading any image will get you the SVG code in XML format. You can 
even upload in .svg format, just know that you already have the code in the file, 
just open the image with any text tool and you'll see the code. ðŸ˜‰

## Why I Created This

I was fed up with the lengthy process of converting images to SVG using various tools. 
So, I made my own tool. It not only saves time but also gives me more control over the 
conversion process and therefor the result.
